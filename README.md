## Motivation
This project was chosen for following reasons:
1. Image data as well as categorical data is avaiable and hence will require customized model.
2. Unlike most image classification problem, the target variable is continuous.
3. Since the ouput is continuous, the network can predict negative values (when age can only be positive).
